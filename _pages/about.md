Hi, my name is Zeqi Zhao [tsɤ́ tɕʰí ʈʂàʊ̯].

I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Theoretical Linguistics at the University of Göttingen, supervised by Professors
[Clemens Mayr](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/clemens+steiner-mayr/569384.html) and [Uwe Junghanns](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/153074.html). My dissertation explores the polymorphism of distributivity in Mandarin, particularly addressing intersections with indefinites, pair-list readings, non-maximality, and homogeneity.

You can also find more information on [my institutional page](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/zeqi+zhao/676254.html).

Research Interests
======
* Formal semantics/pragmatics;
  
* The semantics/pragmatics interface;

* Logic in language;

* Chinese linguistics

Public outreach
======
Modern theoretical linguistics—particularly generative and formal approaches—often bears the “non-scientific” label. My goal is to show the general public that formal semantics goes well beyond abstract formalisms that resemble “pure math”: formal grammars generate precise, testable predictions that can be directly validated against empirical data.

In a joint public talk (with [Nina Haslinger](http://www.ninahaslinger.net/index.html)) at the [5th Night of Science in Göttingen](https://uni-goettingen.de/en/664093.html), I demonstrated how an intuitive understanding of logical consequence is woven into our unconscious language faculty.

Below is the playful comic strip I used in my talk:
