Hi, I currently completing my Ph.D. in Theoretical Linguistics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, supervised by Professors
[Clemens Mayr](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/clemens+steiner-mayr/569384.html) and [Uwe Junghanns](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/153074.html). My dissertation explores the polymorphism of distributivity in Mandarin, examining how semantic structures enable specific interpretations and how
pragmatic factors guide the accessibility of these meanings. It particularly addresses intersections with indefinites, pair-list readings, non-maximality, and homogeneity.

You can also find more information about me on [my institutional page](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/zeqi+zhao/676254.html).
