Traditionally translated as ‘each’, Mandarin _mei_ has been regarded as a strong candidate for universal quantifiers due to its purported ability to express maximality and distributivity.
But _mei_’s status has been debated as it canonically co-occurs with dou, which also appears to
enforce maximality in a manner similar to all. This paper presents novel data showing that _dou_,
rather than _mei_, is responsible for expressing maximality. The existence of distributive items
like _mei_, which enforce distributivity but do not require maximality, underscores the need to
distinguish maximality from distributivity as a separate semantic property, as recently argued
by Haslinger et al. (2025).
