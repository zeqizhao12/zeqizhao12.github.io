title: "How to reconcile maximal and non-maximal 'every'."
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper shows that the existence of distributive items
like Mandarin _mei_, which enforce distributivity but do not require maximality, underscores the need to
distinguish maximality from distributivity as a separate semantic property, as recently argued
by Haslinger et al. (2025).'
